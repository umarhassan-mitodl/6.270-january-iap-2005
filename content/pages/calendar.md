_Workshop 5A - Servos, Sensors, and Shaft Encoders_  
  
Your robot cannot do anything useful without some knowledge of its external surroundings. Your robot will also need mechanisms for which it can navigate swiftly and accurately around the contest table. Learn how these parts in your robotics kit can help your robot move the way you want it to move. Find out which sensors work best for your robot's needs, and how to keep accurately track of how far or at which angle your robot has been moving. Also discuss how to use these unique parts in some more creative ways.  
  
_Workshop 6A - Advanced LEGO®_  
  
Every year many of the more unique pieces of your LEGO® kit are left unexplored and unused. Learn some interesting applications of your stranger LEGO® pieces, and how they can help your robot do task-specific motions.  
  
_Workshop 7A - Code II: Advanced Techniques_  
  
The code for your robot plays a crucial role in your robot's ability to win. Learn the value of good coding practices by observing robots with identical hardware trying to do the same task in different ways. Learn about error recovery techniques and how to achieve robustness in your code and strategy.
