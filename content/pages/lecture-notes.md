Lectures and workshops are the primary way that the material is taught.

Lectures are held during the first week of the course to introduce students to the basics of robotics. These lectures are meant to provide an overview of the information necessary to create a working 6.270 robot.

Workshops are taught by experienced staff members during the first two weeks of the course. These workshops will cover many aspects of the course, from soldering to programming to construction. They are planned to help reinforce the material learned in the lectures.
